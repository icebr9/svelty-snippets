# Svelty Snippets

This extension is providing you with common snippets to use in `.svelte` files

## Features

### Svelte

| Snippet   | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| `sbase`   | Single file component base |
| `sif`     | Svelte {#if} {/if} block   |
| `sifelse` | Svelte {:else}block        |
| `selif`   | Svelte {:else if} block    |

## Requirements

My assumption is that you are using `Svelte Beta` plugin from the marketplace to provide support for `.svelte` files.

## Known Issues

There are a lot of snippets missing, and I will try to add them regularly on our way to 1.0 release.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

- Initial release of Svelty snippets

**Enjoy!**
