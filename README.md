# Svelty Snippets

This extension is providing you with common snippets to use in `.svelte` files

## Features

1. sbase
2. sif
3. sifelse
4. selif

## Requirements

My assumption is that you are using `Svelte Beta` plugin from the marketplace to provide support for `.svelte` files.

## Known Issues

There are a lot of snippets missing, and I will try to add them regularly on our way to 1.0 release.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

- Initial release of Svelty snippets

**Enjoy!**
